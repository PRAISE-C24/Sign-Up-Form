#  Frontend Mentor -  Sign-Up-Form

This is my solution to the [Intro component with sign up form Challenge on Frontend Mentor].

* Note:there are so many ways to complete this challenge, so this is my own way of completing the challenge.

# Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*
